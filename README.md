# Standardized Screenshot

A very opinionated screen capture extension for Google Chrome.

It will:

- Resize the browser window to be `1366px` wide.
- Capture the current tab.
- Add a OS X-ish title bar.
- Add drop shadow to it.
- Display the result in a new tab.
- Resize the browser window to the original size.

Note that the screenshot will be HiDPI-ish (pixel ratio of 2) for print purposes.
